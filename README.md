# Senior Full Stack Developer

Hey there! 👋

I’m a Senior Full Stack Developer who loves building scalable, high-performance web and mobile apps that actually get results. I’ve got tons of experience in backend and frontend dev, and I specialize in integrating AI/ML to make things smoother and keep users engaged.

I’ve worked on all kinds of projects—from Shopify and WordPress to Node.js, React, React Native, and AI tools like TensorFlow. Whether it’s fine-tuning a platform to handle millions of users or speeding up app performance, I’m all about writing clean, reliable code that does the job.

## Here’s what I bring to the table:

- Full-stack experience with a focus on Node.js, React, React Native, and Python.
- A solid background in AI/ML integration and automation.
- A track record of optimizing performance and building scalable systems.
- Comfortable working in fast-paced, agile teams to get things done right and fast.

I’m always down to work on cool, challenging projects that push me to level up. Hit me up if you wanna chat or collaborate!

Let’s build something awesome. 🚀
